password strength is important for security purposes. 
I used the password meter for checking the password strength.
the passwords i used are 1-1234 strength-4%
                         2-Dashing4455 strength-86%
                         3-Superpassword@1597 Strength-100%
here i noticed the things are password should be minimum 8 characters long and include Uppercase,lowercase characters and a special chracter and numbers and should be aware numbers should not be repeatedmore than once.
Brute force:-A brute force attack is a simple attack method that involves guessing username and passwords to gain unauthorized access to a system. It has a high success rate. Brute-force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password.
Dictionary:-Dictionary files are typically done with software or built in password attack tools, instead of an individual manually trying each password. You can also create your own dictionary which you think is closer to the possible password.
